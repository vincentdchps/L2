# FlyonUI Laravel Starter Kit

This starter kit is based on [FlyonUI](https://flyonui.com).

We decided to merge our [LaravelDaily/starter-kit](https://github.com/LaravelDaily/starter-kit) with FlyonUI components.

As a result, you get full **simple** Laravel Auth (*login, register, forget password, profile*), styled as FlyonUI.

The main point is no React/Vue/Livewire required. Only Blade and Tailwind.

Also, you're getting an example table/form with two-level menu on the sidebar to manage Users.
